# Predict with Titanic Dataset
Predict | Random Forest and Decision Tree
============================================================
I did this project as one of my assignments when I was in college for one of the courses.

You all guys can find the dataset yourself *hehehe. I only show the results of a comparison of the accuracy of the two algorithms for prediction

Edit: well, I'll just give you the dataset for you all guys to try
